# Logo Instructions

## Icon Files Needed

Please create and add the following icon files to the `/public` folder:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels

These icons will be used for:
- PWA app icon on home screen
- Favicon
- Splash screens

## Design Suggestions

The logo should represent StarShips - Star Wars Encyclopedia. Consider:
- Space/sci-fi themed design
- Star Wars aesthetic
- Include a starship silhouette or iconic ship design
- Colors: Blues, purples, or galactic theme

## Current Placeholder

Currently using a rocket emoji (🚀) as a placeholder in the app header.
Replace this by updating the logo section in:
- `/components/HomePage.tsx` (line with rocket emoji)
- `/components/AboutPage.tsx` (line with rocket emoji)

## How to Replace

1. Create your logo images (192x192 and 512x512)
2. Save them as `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` in `/public` folder
3. Update the logo display in the components if needed
